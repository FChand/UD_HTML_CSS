How to Center a div and its contents:  (e.g. a centered header)
	To center a div within its container... for example, centering a row inside of the body element.. make the margin: 0 auto;
	So this makes the div itself centered, but the content might still be a block, and there for not centered.
	So in order to center the content you have to do displa:flex, then justify-content: center; (horizontal alignment) then align-items: center;(horizontal alighment)
	

This allows you to use a background image, center it as well. 	
	
header {
   background-image: url(img/hero.jpg);		-> uses the background image properly, instead of href
   background-size: cover;					-> uses the whole image.. if some is cut off, this fixes it
   background-position: center;				-> centers
   height: 100vh;							->100%viewport height
}
